==============================================
= PHP CHECKIN-CHECKIN INSTALLATION PROCEDURE =
==============================================

PHP Checkin-checkout is built on Codeigniter PHP framework,
so if you are familiar with CI, you can go ahead and hit the road
on your own. Otherwise, follow along........

1. SERVER SET-UP
-----------------

Your server needs to be running Apache2, MySQL 5 or greater and
PHP 5 or greater with GD image library for generating barcode
images.

If you are on a windows machine, a quick solution would be downloading
XAMPP server package available here: http://apachefriends.org. Install
it with default values and set apache and MySQL to run as services so
they autostart at boot.

If you are on a linux box, install the LAMPP stack by typing in the terminal:

sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 mysql-server phpmyadmin

This section may not be detailed enough for starters and may require further
information. A simple google search on how to set-up a xampp/lampp server
may be useful. A xampp/lampp stack is strongly recommended for staters
because it includes phpmyadmin which will be very useful when setting up
the database at step 3.

2. SET-UP PHP CHECKIN-CHECKOUT
-------------------------------

Go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpcheckincheckout and download the
software to your local hard drive.

2 - a) WINDOWS SPECIFIC
Extract the contents of the zip archive using windows explorer or another
software of your choice like winrar or winzip.
You should end-up with a single folder called trakka. You can choose to
rename this folder to a name of your choice. For this installation purpose,
we shall leave the name unchanged.
Copy the folder trakka to the webroot folder of your server. If you installed
xampp as earlier suggested, this should be inside C:\xampp\htdocs. So you
should have C:\xampp\htdocs\trakka on your hard drive.

2 - b) LINUX SPECIFIC

Extract the contents of the zip archive:

sudo unzip php-checkincheckout-1.0.zip

You should end up with a directory named trakka. You can choose to rename this
directory to a name of your choice. For the purpose of this installation, we
shall leave it unchanged. However, should you choose to rename it:

sudo mv trakka name_of_your_choice

Copy the directory trakka to the webroot directory of your server. Usually its
inside /var/www so you should have /var/www/trakka if you didnt change the
directory name.To copy it to the webroot directory:

sudo cp -R trakka /var/www/trakka

3. SET-UP THE DATABASE
----------------------

Open up your browser and open the address http://localhost/phpmyadmin
This is only applicable if you are installing on a local machine. If you are
installing on a hosted account, you need to point the browser to your
phpmyadmin.
Log-in to phpmyadmin, click on databases. Under create databses, type in the
name of your new database and click on create. For this installation, we shall
call our database checkincheckout.
Now click on the name of your new database on the list displayed there.

We now have to create tables and insert some default data to get our new
software started. This should be simple.
Click on import and then browse. In the window that opens up, navigate your
way to the file located at /var/www/trakka/database.sql if you are on a linux
box and C:\xampp\htdocs\trakka\database.sql if you are on a windows machine.

Then click on go button. If all went well here, then our database set-up is
done. You can log-out of phpmyadmin now.

4. CONFIGURE THE SOFTWARE
-------------------------

This step is intended to connect our software to the database we've just
created in the previous step so it can read and write data to it.
On windows open C:\xampp\htdocs\trakka\application\config\database.php while
on linux open /var/www/trakka/application/config/database.php in a text editor
of your choice.
Locate these lines:

$db['default']['hostname'] = 'localhost';

$db['default']['username'] = 'root';

$db['default']['password'] = 'root101';

$db['default']['database'] = 'checkincheckout';

These are database connection parameters.
Many a times the first line is left unchanged but may depend on you database
configuration.

The value root on the second line should be replaced with the username you used
when logging in to phpmyadmin when creating the database.

On the third line, replace root101 with the password you used when logging in to
phpmyadmin when creating the database.

On the fourth line, replace checkincheckout with the name of the database you
created at step 3.
WARNING

These are security sensitive values. Do not use root user in real situations
because these values are stored in a file that can be viewed by anyone who
gets access to the server. The values used here are only for instruction
purposes and not intended for use in a production environment.

5. SET BASE URL
---------------

Ignore this section if you did not rename the folder at step 2 and jump to
section 6.

The final step involves setting the routes constant for codeigniter framework
that this software is built on.

On windows open C:\xampp\htdocs\trakka\application\config\config.php and on
linux open /var/www/trakka/application/config/config.php

Locate the line

$config['base_url'] = 'http://'.$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'].'/trakka/';

Replace trakka with the name you chose for the software folder at section 2.

6. LAUNCH THE SOFTWARE
-----------------------

Now launch the software via the browser by pointing to http://localhost/trakka
Replace localhost with your hostname and trakka with the appropriate name you
provided at section 2.

Log-in with:

username/email: info@networkbooks.co.ke
password: changeme

You should go ahead and change these values in a real production environment.

NB: On a linux system, the folder located at /var/www/trakka/images/uploads/
requires the needed permissions to enable uploading of images.
